<!-- If this PR is not ready for review yet, please mark it as Draft. -->

## Template

- **App:** <!-- e.g. Fuzzel -->
- **Template id (directory):** `<id>`
- [ ] New template
- [ ] Update to an existing template

## What it themes

<!-- Which config file(s) of the app get rendered, and what the user sees change. -->

## Testing

<!-- Test it as a user template first (see the README), then say what you ran. -->

- **App version tested:** <!-- e.g. fuzzel 1.11.0 -->
- [ ] Applied a dark theme and confirmed the app picked it up
- [ ] Applied a light theme and confirmed the app picked it up
- [ ] Re-applied twice and the app config is still correct (hooks are idempotent)

## Screenshots

<!-- The app running with the theme applied. Required. -->

## Hooks

<!-- Skip this section if the template has no pre_hook or post_hook. -->

- **What the hook does:** <!-- e.g. rewrites `theme = "..."` in the app's config so it points at the rendered file -->
- [ ] It is idempotent: running it twice does not duplicate lines or corrupt the config.
- [ ] It fails loudly (non-zero exit, message on stderr) when the app's config is missing.
- [ ] It downloads nothing and executes nothing it did not ship in this directory.
- [ ] It touches only this app's own config.

## Checklist

- [ ] The directory name matches the `[catalog.<id>]` id in `template.toml`.
- [ ] `category` is one of: `audio`, `browser`, `compositor`, `editor`, `launcher`, `system`, `terminal`, `misc`.
- [ ] Every `input_path` names a file that exists in this directory.
- [ ] No generated output or app-specific personal config is committed.
